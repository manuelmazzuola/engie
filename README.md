# Engie and A*
_Automatically exported from code.google.com/p/engie_

Two very old little python scripts written when I was sixteen or fourteen :scream:

`Engie`, if I remember correctly, should be a particle simulator, and `A*`, as the name suggests, should be an [A*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm "A*") path finder.


```
# run engie
python2 engie.py
# run A*
python2 A\*/gui.py
```
